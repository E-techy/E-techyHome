   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   /*
    * This section outlines the legal terms and conditions under which the Work (software, documentation, etc.) is provided,
    * allowing for its use, modification, and distribution.
    */

   1. Definitions.

      /*
       * This subsection provides clear definitions for key terms used throughout the license document.
       * This ensures consistent understanding and interpretation of the legal rights and obligations.
       */

      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.
      /* Identifies the entity or individual who owns the copyright and is issuing the license. */

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
      /* Broadly defines a corporate or organizational entity, including its affiliates, to cover all related parties. */

      exercising permissions granted by this License.
      /* Refers to any individual or organization that uses, modifies, or distributes the licensed Work. */

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.
      /* Describes the human-readable and modifiable format of the Work, like source code. */

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.
      /* Describes the compiled or processed, typically non-human-readable, form of the Work. */

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
      /* Refers to the original copyrighted material being licensed. */

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
      /* Defines modifications or enhancements built upon the original Work, distinguishing them from mere aggregations. */

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
      /* Specifies any original or modified content intentionally submitted to the Licensor for incorporation into the Work. */

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
      /* Identifies all parties who have contributed to the Work, including the original Licensor. */

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
      /*
       * This section grants a broad, unconditional copyright license to users,
       * allowing extensive freedom to use, modify, and distribute the Work globally and without fees.
       */

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.
      /*
       * This section grants a patent license covering contributions to the Work,
       * but it includes a "patent retaliation" clause: initiating patent litigation against the Work
       * or its contributions will result in termination of your patent license under this document.
       */

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      /*
       * This section specifies the mandatory conditions for redistributing the Work,
       * ensuring that recipients are aware of the license terms and origin.
       */

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
          /* Ensures all recipients receive the terms of use. */

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and
          /* Requires clear identification of modifications made by You. */

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and
          /* Mandates preservation of original legal notices in source distributions. */

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.
          /* Outlines specific requirements for handling the NOTICE file, if present, ensuring attribution is maintained. */

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.
      /* Allows You to apply your own copyright and (compatible) license terms to your modifications, separate from the original Work. */

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
      /*
       * This section clarifies that any contributions You make to the Work are
       * automatically licensed under the Apache License 2.0, unless a separate agreement exists.
       */

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
      /*
       * This section explicitly states that the license does not grant rights
       * to use the Licensor's trademarks, protecting their brand identity.
       */

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
      /*
       * This section is a strong disclaimer that the Work is provided "as-is,"
       * meaning no warranties (express or implied) are offered by the Licensor or Contributors,
       * and users assume all risks associated with its use.
       */

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
      /*
       * This section severely limits the liability of Contributors for any damages
       * resulting from the use or inability to use the Work, protecting them from extensive legal claims.
       */

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
      /*
       * This section allows You to offer additional warranties or support for a fee,
       * but explicitly states that You do so on your own behalf and must indemnify
       * other Contributors from any liability arising from these additional commitments.
       */
